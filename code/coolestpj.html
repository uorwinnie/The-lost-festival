        <em>Thingyan</em> is a water festival that is held annually, typically
        during the second or third week of April, to mark the Myanmar New Year.
        Thingyan is a word derived from Sanskrit, that means change and
        accordingly, the Thingyan Festival marks the changing of the old year to
        the new.<br /><br />In the Burmese calendar, which is a lunar calendar,
        it is a movable feast,ut it is flexible in the solar year,which explains
        the fact that wheras it falls on different Burmese dates in different
        years, it falls usually during the period 13 th to 16 th April and very
        occasionally during the period 13 th to 17 th April or 14th to 16 th
        April in the western solar calendar.<br /><br />First day of Thingyan
        days is called “A Kyo”, the day that starts the various kinds of
        religious activities and which follows by the second day “A Kya”, third
        day “A Kyat” and the final day as “A Tat”. In the leap year, there is
        one extra day of “A Kyat” so there will be two “A Kyat” days. After
        these four or five days, the Myanmar lunar calendar changes to very
        first day of New Year. Thingyan holidays are the most important public
        holidays and the school year ends for all students & the summer holidays
        begin.<br /><br />
        The festival features many traditional rituals and customs, including
        the splashing of water and dousing each other in water as a way of
        cleansing the old year's sins and welcoming the new year with joy and
        happiness. Although Thingyan is a religious festival basically, its main
        feature is water-throwing.

        Since ancient time, dominent religion of Myanmar(Burma) has been
        Buddhism. A lot of buddhist people keep the Sabbath during thingyan and
        men use to enter the monkhook before Thingyan eve day and leave the
        monkhook after tne first day of Myanmar new year(Nit-San-Ta-Yat).<br />
        In some houses, people prepare a Thingyan pot(ah-tar-oh) as a
        traditional to welcomethe King of Devas, Thagya Min. Some people fast,
        some people go on a vegetarian diet, some people go on a mediation
        retreat and some go to monasteries,buddhist temples to do good deeds
        such as sweeping the floor where people meditate, offer flowers,candles
        and scented water to buddha statues.
