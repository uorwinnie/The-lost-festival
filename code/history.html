      According to the history, the first Water Festival is Thingyan as it
      started during the Kingdom of Tagaung (1st Century CE - 1050 AD) and
      become widespread and famous during the Kingdom of Bagan (849 AD - 1297
      AD).<br />Thingyan traces its roots back to a Hindu myth. The King of
      Brahmas called Arsi, lost a wager to the King of Devas, Thagya Min, who
      decapitated Arsi. Miraculously, the head of an elephant was placed onto
      Arsi's body, and he then became Ganesha. The Hindu god was so powerful
      that if his head was thrown into the sea it would dry up immediately. If
      it were thrown onto land it would be scorched. If it were thrown up into
      the air the sky would burst into flames. Thagya Min therefore ordained
      that Ganesha's head be carried by one princess after another who took
      turns for a year each. The new year thus has come to signify the this
      annual change of hands.
