        As a symbolization of strength and durability, this kind of tree can be
        used for furniture design and making. The golden fragrant flowers of
        Padauk are also considered as the national flower of Myanmar. While the
        tree symbolizes strength, the flower represents youth, love and romance
        with its fragrant scent.<br /><br />Blooming during April, the flower
        seems to be a sign of the first showers in April and the New Year
        celebrations as well.Burmese women wear Padauk on their head and also
        offer before our household shrines. If no thingyan shower for the month
        of april, we rarely see the beautiful Padauk on Thingyan month.<br /><br />Burmese
        say that padauk is a sign of faith. In burmese poems, they say padauk
        blooms once in the month of a year, during Thingyan.That's why people
        call padauk as the signature of Thingyan. Youths of Myanmar use to
        compare their love with padauk.
